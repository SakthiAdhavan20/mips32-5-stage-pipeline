## Abstract
This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 RISC Processor using Verilog. It demonstrates instruction execution with pipelining, including data and control hazards handling, achieving improved instruction throughput.

---

## Introduction
- Motivation for pipelining in processors.  
- Overview of the MIPS32 Instruction Set Architecture used.  
- Objective of this project.

---

## Design and Implementation

### ISA Overview
- Supported instructions include arithmetic, logic, load/store, branch, and jump instructions.  
- Instruction formats: R-type, I-type, and J-type.  

### Datapath Diagrams
- Non-pipelined datapath diagram.  
- 5-stage pipelined datapath diagram.

### Modules
- Control Unit  
- Register File  
- ALU  
- Pipeline Registers  
- Data Memory  
- Forwarding and Hazard Detection Units  

---

## Results and Verification
- Simulation results for key instructions (ADD, SUB, LW, SW, BEQ, JUMP).  
- Waveform snapshots for verification.  
- Console output showing register and memory updates.

---

## Conclusion
- Achievements of the project.  
- Limitations, if any.  
- Possible future improvements such as branch prediction, exception handling, or supporting more instructions.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Icarus Verilog  
- GTKWave  

### Steps
```bash
# Compile
iverilog -o mips32_sim.out top_module.v testbench.v

# Run simulation
vvp mips32_sim.out

# View waveforms
gtkwave dump.vcd

```
